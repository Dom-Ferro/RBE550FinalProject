# RBE550: Motion Planing - Final Project
**Title :** Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance & Path Planning in a Hospital Environment

Description
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project aims to address the challenge of safe and efficient mobility for mobile robots in hospital environments. Prompt delivery of supplies, equipment, and medication is critical in hospitals, but the environment is dynamic and complex, with various obstacles such as equipment, medical staff, and patients. The conventional path planning techniques such as Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) or Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM) make assumptions about static impediments and cannot manage non-holonomic restrictions. Therefore, the project aims to implement path planning algorithms that are efficient in dynamic environments and can take into account the non-holonomic limits of mobile robots. By doing so, the project aims to improve the efficiency and safety of mobile robots in hospital environments, ultimately improving the quality of patient care.
For this project, we have tested out out three different planning algorithms, namely D*, Hybrid Potential Based PRM (HPPRM), Spline based Dynamic Windows Approach(DWA).
